Mobile Computing Project:30%

## Task 1: Data collecting
1)	Obtain data from IMPACT Lab.
2)	Understand data format
3)	Understand stimuli
4)	Segment data using stimuli

## Task 2: Scientific Design
1)	Find stimulus(incongruity). Use 3-4 different stimulus
2)	Data collection. Collect significant data.
3)	Training/ testing (weka). Separate the collect data into training and testing.
4)	Machine learning. Use different machine learning algorithms to analysis the data.(SVM, Deep learning)
5)	Accuracy analysis.

## Task 3: Signal Processing

1)	Find the stimulus (incongruity) Use 3-4 different stimulus.
2)	Data collection
3)	Extract brain data after 300 millisecond for 1 s. Design a Signal processing algorithm to detect N300 using a peak detection algorithm(-ve responses) after which has a slow wavering sine wave.
4)	Implement in real time(Matlab). Read in data from a file and perform a continuous detection
5)	Performance analysis(real time) i.e. Time taken to detect N300. Task 4: Using P300&N300 To Predict User Input
1)	Develop an UI to deliver the stimulus(TBD) and collect brain data. Synchronization is required to determine the window of P300/N300.
2)	Collect userâ€™s brain signal and ask for their feedback. (Obtain user feedback via the GUI). a-x, b-x, c-v; a-v; a-x,b-x,t-v ----> CAT.
3)	Annotate the brain data.
4)	Look for N300 and P300 response.
5)	Validate the claim by comparing the user feedback and the brain data. (i.e. 88% accuracy.)
